### Hi there, I am Kamran ðŸ‘‹ :computer:

I am a data analyst/developer, currently finalising my PhD on monitoring machine health using data analystics, advanced sensing and signal processing techniques.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m passionate about R and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS (MERN).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on integrating R and Python with NodeJS.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love volleyball and football :soccer: but find Esports CSGO :video_game: much more entertaining to watch.
